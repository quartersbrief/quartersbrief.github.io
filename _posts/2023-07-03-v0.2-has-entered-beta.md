title: v0.2 has entered beta status
---
Quartersbrief second major release has entered beta phase.

## What does this mean?

v0.2 has now reached a feature set and maturity that I consider close to being releasable. The overarching theme for this release has been the handling of ships' armor data. The algorithm for this has been refined quite a bit by now.

With the move to beta status, v0.2 is under feature freeze: no new features will be implemented anymore. During the beta phase, bugs in the existing feature set will be addressed, before v0.2 will be published as a stable release.

Quartersbrief is still under active development, and I still have new plans and ideas. The next major version - v0.3 - is planned to focus on gunnery.

## What's new in this release?

Major improvements in this release:

- Added new topics HE & SAP Vulnerability and HE & SAP Penetration
- Improved both speed and output quality of armor view generation
- Added headline with battle tier, time, player ship and map name to briefings
- Updated branding to new logo and logotype
- Supported topic reordering using the new `position` attribute
