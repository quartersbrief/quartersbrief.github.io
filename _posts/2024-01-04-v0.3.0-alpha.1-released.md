A new prerelease version of quartersbrief is available to test more internal improvements. 

## Intent and rationale 

The [previous alpha version]({% post_url 2023-12-27-v0.3.0-alpha.0-released %}) was intended to check the real-world fitness of internal changes. This test has gone well.

At the same time, development has progressed with more internal remodelling. While the last alpha changed the way data was _provided_ to quartersbrief, this version fundamentally changes the way data is _presented_ to quartersbrief. Again, this is mostly an internal change designed to increase stability and testability, although it will simplify the use of [has clauses]({% post_url 2023-01-28-new-features-for-agendas %}#new-has-clause) and facilitate more powerful filtering rules in topics (although this is not implemented yet).

Like the previous alpha release, this release is intended to test those changes in a real-world setting both in terms of functionality and performance.

## Changes

- Completely changed the way data is represented internally
- Fixed a bug that caused the Winrate topic to consistently crash after the first briefing
