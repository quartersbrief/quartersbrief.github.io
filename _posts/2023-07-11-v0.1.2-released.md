As [v0.2 is preparing to become the new stable version]({% post_url 2023-07-03-v0.2-has-entered-beta %}), the current stable version has seen a minor update.

The new version brings a better layout algorithm for the Hydro topic that prevents ship labels from obscuring each other. This change was backported from the v0.2 branch, which will see it in the next release.

You can download it from the [downloads page]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) or find out more on the [release page](https://github.com/quartersbrief/quartersbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.2).
