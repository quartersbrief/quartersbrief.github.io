title: "New stable release: v0.2.1"
---
This release restores compatibility with game versions 0.12.10 and higher.

When Wargaming released the October update, quartersbrief suddenly stopped working, as the invariant 'every game object has a well-formed property "index"' would fail and prevent quartersbrief's data update mechanism from completing. This release addresses this.

You can download it from the [downloads page]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) or find out more on the [release page](https://github.com/quartersbrief/quartersbrief/releases/tag/v0.2.1).
