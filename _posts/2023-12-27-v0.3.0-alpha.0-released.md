The first alpha of quartersbrief's next major version jump is available. 

This alpha incorporates [major internal changes]({% post_url 2023-12-10-a-new-way-of-providing-data %}), but otherwise provides no new features over the [latest stable release]({% post_url 2023-10-16-v0.2.1-released %}). It is intended to test those changes in a real-world setting both in terms of functionality and performance.

This version may take significantly longer to perform game data updates, but should be faster in both start-up and briefing generation.

It is recommended that you completely uninstall quartersbrief v0.2 before installing this alpha.

For a full changelog please refer to the [release page][v0.3.0-alpha.0-release].
You can download it from the [downloads page]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) or find out more on the [release page][v0.3.0-alpha.0-release].
